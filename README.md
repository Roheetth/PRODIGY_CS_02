Task2-Implementation of Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption

# Image Encryption with Pixel Manipulation

This project implements an image encryption technique using pixel manipulation. By altering the pixel values in an image, the original image can be transformed into an encrypted version that can only be deciphered using the appropriate decryption algorithm. This method leverages the Python Imaging Library (Pillow) for handling image processing tasks.

## Introduction

Image encryption is crucial in protecting sensitive visual data from unauthorized access. This project showcases a simple yet effective method of encrypting and decrypting images through pixel manipulation. The primary goal is to demonstrate how pixel values can be altered systematically to transform an image into an unreadable format and then revert it to its original form.

## Features

- **Pixel Manipulation**: Change pixel values to encrypt and decrypt images.
- **User-Friendly**: Easy-to-use interface for image encryption and decryption.
- **Extensible**: Framework that can be extended with more complex encryption algorithms.
